        <img src="Nilaveli.jpg"><br><br>

        <p>
            Renowned for the golden beaches that encompass the island, Sri Lanka has long attracted tourists seeking sand, 
            sun-bathing, swimming, water sports, deep sea fishing and diving. Quaint coastal hamlets have expanded to
             welcome tourists staying in homely guesthouses, mainstream hotels or luxury boutique villas by the sea. 
             Fringed by palm trees, with soft sand and azure waters, these beaches make an ideal holiday location beside
              the Indian Ocean.
            Thriving tourist hotspots, like the beaches of Negombo near the airport and to the South of Colombo, 
            Mount Lavinia, Bentota, Galle, Unawatuna and Mirissa, and in the East Trincomalee, Passikudah and Arugam Bay,
             are great destinations for our tailor-made tours, or for any type of getaway, with budget-friendly to top-notch 
             ury accommodation, and they boast many restaurants, bars and fun activities too.

             cultural heritage.
            Historical sites such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla, once home to ancient kingdoms, still retain many
             relics and artefacts of bygone eras. The famous rock fortress of Sigiriya and the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic 
              Kandy, are must-see places. A multi-religious country, Sri Lanka has many religious festivals that take place year

        <img src="mountain.jpg"><br><br>

        <p>Kandy, the hill capital can be accessed by both land and air. The most popular land route is by train which
             offers amazing scenic views of the countryside. Trains leave daily from the Fort Railway Station in Colombo.
              Kandy is also accessible by air greatly reducing travelling time.
            The town of Nuwara Eliya still retains much of its British colonial charm that has earned it the nickname 
            Little England. Nestled 2,000 metres above sea level it is one of the coldest regions of Sri Lanka with an 
            annual average temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. Relax inside a colonial home and drink tea considered to be
             the best in the world. For the adventurous a trek through Horton Plains and Worlds End is a rewarding encounter

        <p>
            Sri Lanka’s wildlife ranges from wild elephants and leopards to sea turtles and a vast variety of birds.
             Sri Lanka’s Yala National Park is known to have the highest density of leopards in the world. National parks
              and bird sanctuaries, particularly in the southern and central zones, have the best opportunities to see 
              animals in their natural habitat. Stay alert for a sighting of the endangered sloth bear or leopard, watch
               hundreds of elephants feeding and washing in a tank or lagoon during “the gathering”; or be amazed by the
                egg laying sea turtles. Our tours include many possibilities for wildlife watching and birding.

            with traditional Sinhala and indigenous medicine.
            Ayuveda is a holistic approach to health and wellbeing, and is based on herbs and diet. Sri Lanka is blessed
             with an abundant supply of medicinal plants, herbs and spices, which are carefully used not just to heal or
              mitigate a particular disease or ailment, but also to promote the overall wellbeing of the patient. It also
