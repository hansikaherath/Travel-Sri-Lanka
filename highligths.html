                <h2> Highlights</h2>
                <p>Located off the south coast of India, Sri Lanka is known as 'Teardrop Island' due to its shape. 
                    It is divided into nine provinces: Central Province with Kandy at its core, also known as the Hill
                     Country. North Central Province, or the Cultural Triangle, is home to ancient kingdoms. North Western Province is the land of secret
                      beaches unlike the Southern Province where crammed coastlines are rarely secrets. The tea plantation province of Ula is for
                       getting lost in lusciousness in contrast with Western Province which is one big sprawling mass of Colombo. And, new to the tourist
                        map, Northern Province, which is slowly recovering from post-war destruction and the Eastern Province, which surfers have 
                       known about for years with miles of beaches in Trincomalee now opening up thanks to peaceful times.</p>

                <h4>1.Kandy</h4>
                <p>Sweet as. Ruled by the Kings of Kandy since 15th Century until it fell to the British in 1815, this still
                     feels like its own kingdom. Majestic and revered, many come simply on pilgrimage to the Temple of the Tooth,
                      a sacred tooth belonging to the Buddha, and main reason for its UNESCO World Heritage status. Also a 
                      natural haven with cooling hill country all around, mostly tea plantations, as well as jungle keeping it real.
                       And accessible by train..</p>

                  stands 160m over the town. Now five main caves packed with statues of Buddha, kings & also Hindu gods.
                   Bit of a climb to get up there, but worth it for views across plains to Sigiriya. Visit the caves in
                    reverse order for ‘stunning’ to ‘gobsmacking’ experience.</p>

                   r which the Buddha was enlightened in 544 BCE. Don’t miss the Twin Ponds for cool construction in both
                    senses of the word.</p>

            <p>
                Trincomalee (Trinco) sits on one the world’s finest natural harbours. This historic city is old almost beyond reckoning: it’s possibly the site of historic Gokana in the Mahavamsa (Great Chronicle), and its Shiva temple the site of Trikuta Hill in the Hindu text Vayu Purana. Most people just pass through the city on their way to the nearby beaches of Uppuveli and Nilaveli, but the town has some charm, plenty of history and an interesting melange of people.
